# DevOps CI/CD Journey 🚀

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey in **DevOps** with a strong focus on **Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Deployment / Delivery (CD)**.  
It serves as a practical lab where I experiment with tools, pipelines, and best practices used in modern software delivery.

The goal of this repository is not just theory, but **real, working pipelines** that take code from development to deployment.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand CI/CD concepts and workflows
- Build automated pipelines for build, test, and deployment
- Learn industry-standard DevOps tools
- Practice infrastructure and application automation
- Create a reusable reference for future projects

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies (Planned / In Progress)

- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub  
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, Jenkins  
- **Containers**: Docker, Docker Compose  
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Database**: MongoDB  
- **Cloud & Deployment**: AWS (EC2, S3 – planned)  
- **DevOps Concepts**:  
  - Build automation  
  - Testing automation  
  - Environment-based deployments  
  - Pipeline optimization

## 🔄 CI/CD Workflow (High Level)

1. Developer pushes code to GitHub
2. CI pipeline triggers automatically
3. Code is built and tested
4. Docker images are created
5. Deployment is executed to the target environment
6. Feedback is provided via logs and status checks
